Todo:
1. consistent look and feel and usability review
2. update the text/wording throughout app

Completed/In-progress:
i. players and timer start solving only when all players have clicked
ii. advanced statistics (puzzle number, mystery scramble)
- Who is this for?  What do players need to know versus admins?
iii. more control over "levels" (how many scrambles per round, time limit of each
    round, which puzzles in each round, etc)
